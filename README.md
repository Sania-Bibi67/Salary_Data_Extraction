# Salary Data Extraction

## Overview

This project contains two apps:
### App1
App1 sends alphabetic keys via an HTTP Trigger to salary-jobtitle-keys queue. Queue Trigger 1 fetches job titles and sends them to another queue, while Queue Trigger 2 scrapes the titles and stores them in the database.

### App2
App2â€™s HTTP Trigger retrieves job titles from the database and sends them to salary-queue1. Queue Triggers then generate links, scrape location-specific data, and finally extract salary details, storing everything in the database.
